It is a result of causes accumulated and piled up.
34,1,34,,,To say why it is that I am angry: it is because the wrongdoing has not been removed.,rippuku mo naniyue naru to yu naraba   akuji ga nokan yue no koto nari,りいふくもなにゆへなるどゆうならハ,あくじがのかんゆへの事なり,立腹も何故なると言うならば   悪事が退かん故の事なり,"If you ask the reason wherefore I am angry, it is because your wrongdoing has not yet stopped."

37,1,37,,,"If this wrongdoing is completely cleared away, the lameness of your leg, also, will be cleared away.",kono akuji sukiyaka noketa koto naraba   ashi no chinba mo sukiyaka to naru,このあくじすきやかのけた事ならバ,あしのちんばもすきやかとなる,この悪事清きやか退けた事ならば   足の跛も清きやかとなる,"Only if this wrongdoing is entirely done away with, the lameness of the leg will be completely cured."
38,1,38,,,"If only your leg is made completely well, nothing will remain but to prepare for the construction.",ashi saika sukiyaka naori shita naraba   ato wa fushin no moyo bakari o,あしさいかすきやかなをりしたならバ,あとハふしんのもよふハかりを,足さいか清きやか直りしたならば   後は普請の模様ばかりを,"Only if the lameness of the leg is completely cured, you can devote yourself single-heartedly to arrangements for the construction."
39,1,39,,,Just a word: returning her by the thirtieth of the first month is also from the mind of God.,choto hanashi shogatsu misoka to hi o kirite   okuru mo Kami no kokoro kara tote,一寸はなし正月三十日とひをきりて,をくるも神の心からとて,一寸話正月三十日と日を切りて   送るも神の心からとて,Just a word!
